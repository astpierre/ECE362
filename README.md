# ECE 362: Microprocesor System Design and Interfacing
  Course Description: An introduction to basic computer organization, microprocessor instruction sets, assembly language programming, the design of various types of digital as well as analog interfaces, and microprocessor system design considerations. The accompanying laboratory is designed to provide practical hands-on experience with microprocessor software applications and interfacing techniques. Topics include a detailed study of a particular microcomputer architecture and instruction set, assembly language programming techniques, system control signals and I/O structure, memory system design, I/O port design and handshaking protocols, interrupt control systems, parallel and serial interface subsystems, counter/timer subsystems, and analog (data and control) interfaces.
  
  NOTE: Since I am currently taking this course (Spring 2018) these are my weekly solutions to lab experiements. 

# Contents:
  experiment2.S is an Assembly program that performs some simple Assembly instructions. PUSH/POP from stack, word addition, comparator, and embedded division.
  
  experiment3.S is an Assembly program that blinks LEDs on the microcontroller dev board. GPIO introduction.
  
  experiment4.S is an Assembly program that debounces the user button on the uC. It also includes a reaction timer game. GPIO application.
  
  experiment5.C is an embedded C version of experiment4. Purpose being to transition the course to embedded C programming.
  
  experiment6.C is an embedded C program that explores the ADC peripheral of the STM32F0 uC.
